Open the ToyCraft Manufacturers.twbx file.

🔍 Problem Statement
Understanding how and where toy manufacturers operate is vital for identifying industry shifts, consolidation, and growth opportunities. This project helps stakeholders gain insights into trends over time, geographical concentration, and the overall health of the toy manufacturing sector.

🧰 Dataset & Cleaning
The dataset used was fully cleaned and ready for analysis—no additional data cleaning steps were required. It included complete records of manufacturers with fields such as year, state, and an index value used purely for visualization.

📊 Key Visualizations & Insights
Yearly Manufacturer Trends (2005–2016): A clear decline from ~1,600 to ~1,100 manufacturers, indicating possible consolidation or declining new launches.
Index Distribution: Binning by index value highlights shifts in concentration — especially in years like 2014–2015.
State-level Activity: Visualizations (bubble and bar charts) show California, Texas, Florida, and Washington as leading states in toy manufacturing.
State Ranking Funnel: Reveals top states with steep drop-offs, emphasizing major vs. minor industry contributors.
